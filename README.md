# Socks

The presentation tool for [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com). Socks has a simple JSON based declarative syntax like CSS that is very easy to understand and write in. Hence you can cook up a presentation in a few minutes. Socks will use Shoes to convert that to a presentation automatically.

That was just to grab your attention. The implementation of Socks is still incomplete and I am working on it. Any kind of help is appreciated. Just for this repo, hack on it, and send me a pull request!
